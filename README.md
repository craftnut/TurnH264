How to run from source (Every OS): </br>
Install PySide6: `pip install PySide6` </br>
Place an `ffmpeg` executable in the same directory as `TurnH264.py` </br>
FFmpeg builds are available at https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html </br>
Everything should work on Windows and Linux, macOS is untested.

### Would like to implement:
-   [] Progress bar
-   [X] FFmpeg downloader
-   [] FFmpeg NVENC build support
