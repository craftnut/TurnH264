How to run from source (Every OS): </br>
Install requirements: ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` </br>
FFmpeg builds are available at https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html, but they should automatically download </br>
Everything should work on Windows and Linux, while it is not tested on other systems, it should work on any machine that supports Python and FFmpeg. </br>

### Would like to implement:
-   [X] Progress bar
-   [X] FFmpeg downloader
-   [ ] Proper macOS support
-   [ ] ~~FFmpeg NVENC build support~~ Delayed indefinitely
